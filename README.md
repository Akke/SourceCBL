# SourceCBL
SourceCBL is a non-profitable organization that lets other communities keep hackers out of their SourceMod servers through a global banlist. This ensures all server running our service will be safe from notorious (and not so notorious) cheaters. 

We strive for improvement and enhancement of any Source-related platforms, this is achieved through our API. This API is a sorted list of hackers and cheats which keeps unwanted players out of your servers.

All bans on this list are hand chosen and sorted by our very merticulously picked staff. The staff follow a very stringent set of rules and policies to prevent any misgivings and abuse of our system.
