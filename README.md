# SourceCBL
SourceCBL is a non-profitable organization that lets other communities keep hackers out of their SourceMod servers without having to ban them on their own, by using our database containing all hackers from multiple communities. 

We strive after improving the gameplay on all Source-related community servers and we can achieve this by working together and having our own powerful API that everyone can access. 

All bans in our database are submitted by community admins and our own staff, while following a very strict policy to ensure quality of our bans.

Our service is completely free, so what are you waiting for? Protect your servers in a few simple steps.
